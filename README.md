# Abstract
Designing sustainable fuel blends by adding eco-friendly pre-mixtures of chemical compounds (gasoline compounding) may help to reduce environmentalimpact. However, experimental testing of all possible pre-mixtures is time and resources consuming. Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning (AI/ML) models may help to reduce experimentation cost but there are not publicly available datasets with detailed chemical composition of gasoline blends. Different IFPTML models were trained/validatedusing the Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR) compared to different Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) algorithms such Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Deep Learning Network (DLN), Radial Basis Function (RBF).  The best IFPTML models found were able topredict the RON and MON values of these blends with R2 in the range 0.89 - 0.99 in training and validation series. We release here the C++ code of the ANN models trainined in this work. The new model may useful eco-friendly gasoline blends design with lower environmental impact.
